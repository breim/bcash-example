# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Items = Item.create([{ name: 'Moto', price: 1500 }, { name: 'Bombom Vegano', price: 3.20 }])
